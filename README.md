I have developed a weather application using React.js and the Open Weather API. This application allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for different locations worldwide.

Key Features:
- Retrieve real-time weather data from the Open Weather API.
- Display current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Provide forecasts for the upcoming days.
- Allow users to search for weather information for specific locations.

This project helped me enhance my skills in React.js development and integrating external APIs into web applications. I have thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and am excited to share it with the community on GitHub.

Feel free to check out the live demo of the application [here](https://react-js-weather1.netlify.app/) and explore the source code on my GitHub repository [here](github.com/ikromjon-ismoiljonov-dev/Weather-App-using-ReactJS).

Thank you for your interest!
